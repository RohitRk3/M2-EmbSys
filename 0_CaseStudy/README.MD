## Component Details
  ## Main Components
      1.In Cab Controller
      2.Air Distribution Box
      3.Power Supply
## Applications
      Proper tire inflation helps prevent accelerated wear that leads to premature tire replacement and is also important to safety. Tires that are driven under-inflated
      generate excessively high heat levels that can weaken the tire to the point of failure.
